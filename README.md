#  Color Logic Balls – Visual Problem Solving Project

An interactive JavaScript canvas project that demonstrates **problem-solving logic, graph-style interactions, and visual effects** using moving colored balls.

Each ball behaves like a **graph node**, and logical rules are applied based on color similarity. The project focuses on **logic first, visuals second**.

##  Project Concept

- Balls represent **nodes**
- Colors represent **node groups**
- Distance-based interactions simulate **graph relationships**
- Same color → attraction  
- Different color → repulsion  

The goal is to **group same-colored balls together** by adjusting logic and interaction strength.

---

##  Features

-  Multiple moving colored balls
- Logic-based attraction & repulsion
- Graph-style visual connections between balls
- Click any ball to change its color
- Magnet strength slider to control logic force
-  Real-time score based on correct groupings
-  Smooth canvas animation

---

##  Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- HTML Canvas API

---
## 🧩 How It Works (Logic Overview)

1. Each frame calculates distance between balls  
2. If balls are close:
   - Same color → attract
   - Different color → repel
3. Graph edges are drawn between nearby balls
4. Score increases when same-color balls cluster
5. User interaction changes system state dynamically
